"Juego-Dados is a version of a classic dice game Push Your Luck. Each round, you roll two dice as "blockers." Then roll five dice as long as you wish, getting the number of points each die shows. The catch is if you roll the same number as one of the blockers (it's possible, but unlikely, for both blockers to be the same number), you don't get points for that die and can no longer roll it. If you keep rolling until you roll all blockers, you get zero points for that round. You may stop at any time. There are a total of five rounds. The player with the highest total for the game wins.

For example, assume 2 and 5 are your blockers. On your first roll, you roll 3, 5, 4, 1, and 3. You get 11 points (3 + 4 + 1 + 3) and the die you rolled a 5 on is removed from play. Your next roll, you roll 2, 3, 5, and 5. Your total is now 14 (11 + 3), but you've only got one die left to roll. This is a good time to stop! (Don't push your luck too much.)"
